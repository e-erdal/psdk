# Features
- Cross platform rendering API.
- Vertex Array layout.
- Framebuffers.
- Vertex batching.

# In-plan
- SDK currently supports OpenGL. Make it also supports BGFX so we can port it anywhere.
- Currently runs on Win32 only. Tested on Android before but worked on specific devices. Maybe EGL handling was wrong?
- Asset manager.
- Entity component system.
- Input handling.

# Target
- Make some working game prototype.

# Future
- 3D.
